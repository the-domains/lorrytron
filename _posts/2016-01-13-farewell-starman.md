# Farewell Starman

I'm not a true Bowie fan, but like many, I think everyone has heard and experienced many of his creations in one way or another - whether through his music, films or otherwise. As news of his death filters through the media, we're currently being inundated with many of those memories which I find very interesting reading, listening and watching. 

This one is great. Two legends doing what they do best... Entertaining.
